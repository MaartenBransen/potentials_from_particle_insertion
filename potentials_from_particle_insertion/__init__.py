Description
-----------
Python package with a set of functions for calculating the g(r) using the 
Widom test-particle insertion method, and/or for fitting the g(r) to solve for
the pair-potential using particle coordinates from e.g. confocal microscopy or 
cryo-TEM.

The codes for this package were developed as part of the work in reference [1],
where the iterative use of test-particle insertion to solve for the pair 
potential was based on [2] with correction for periodic or finite boundary 
conditions based on equations described in [3,4]
